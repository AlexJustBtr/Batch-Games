This one has music still outdated though.
if you want the music to work follow:

1. download vlc here "https://get.videolan.org/vlc/3.0.20/win32/vlc-3.0.20-win32.exe"

1.5. edit the rpg game1.1(music).bat with a text editor

2. scroll to the bottom to where it says ":playmusic"

3. where it says "C:\Desktop\rpg game\Soundtrack.mp3" put your on directory in

4. only this part should change: "\Desktop\" if it doesnt its ok cause you saved it on your destop

5. if you on a specific user it will look smth like this: "C:\Users\Alex\Desktop\rpg game\Soundtrack.mp3"

6. if you changed it properly it will work fine, just run it
